#iwhd-only setup configuration.

#renaming this file to <fqdn>_configure will
#make it override the default configure everything
#behavior with the behavior below to only set up

#NOTE:  Although this suggests the components
#can be deployed on individual boxes.  This will likely
#become a common practice, but be advised that currently
#apart from https on the web server for conductor, you should
#consider intermachine communications insecure.  Securing
#intermachine service calls is on the roadmap.
