This directory contains a pair of default_ yml files to describe
a fully configured aeolus-conductor w/ all of required subcomponents
on a single box.

Additionally, the iwhd pair of files demonstrates how one could install
only select components on a particular box (for this to be located correctly
it should be renamed to <fqdn>_cleanup & <fqdn>_configure respectively.
Doing so will override the default 'configure everything' description though.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  https is on by default, but no other security is in place
to ensure that components on different machines can interact in a secure
fashion.  This is on the roadmap, but not currently in place.  Segregate
services at your own risk.

Kerberos can be used only with https enabled. Your system has to be
configured for kerberos authentication.
